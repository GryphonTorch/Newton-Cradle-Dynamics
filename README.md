# Newton-Cradle-Dynamics
This python 2.7 code simulates the motion of balls in a Newton's Cradle, a common physics toy used to demonstrate momentum conservation. 
In real-life, the balls lose energy in collisions and eventually come to a stop. 
The code uses Euler-Richardson numerical integration to calculate the balls' paths, subject to a Hertz-Kurobawa viscoelastic damping force.
